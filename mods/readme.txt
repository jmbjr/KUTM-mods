TODO - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Drop any mod packages into this directory and the launcher should discover them.

Enable mods in the launcher to use them in-game.

Note that the "base" mod should not be modified. If you'd like to change something defined in it, you can create a new mod with a matching definition or asset and it will replace the base mod version.
